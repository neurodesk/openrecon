# OpenRecon Image-to-Image Example

`openreconi2iexample` is a lightweight OpenRecon image-in/image-out example.
It expects already reconstructed MRD image messages and returns simple derived
label series. It is intended as a readable reference for scanner-safe output
series handling, not as a clinical segmentation algorithm.

## What It Demonstrates

1. Drain the full OpenRecon input connection before processing.
2. Group processable magnitude images by `image_series_index`.
3. Sort slices by physical position using each image position and slice
   direction.
4. Compute image matrix, field of view, voxel size, and measured slice spacing.
5. Allocate all derived output series from one connection-level allocator after
   input drain.
6. Create three simple label outputs by thresholding the input volume.
7. Stamp each derived output with coherent MRD header, Meta, and IceMiniHead
   identity.
8. Validate the output series contract before any image is sent back.

The hard pre-send validation is deliberate: if derived series identity is
ambiguous or collides with the input, the app fails loudly instead of returning
partial output that a scanner might hide or merge.

## Inputs

The app is designed for image input, not raw k-space reconstruction. Magnitude
images are processed. Unsupported or non-magnitude images are buffered and
returned unchanged after validation of the derived outputs.

Each processable image series should contain one 2D slice per MRD image. Slices
must have matching in-plane dimensions. The wrapper checks that the drained
slice count is compatible with the MRD header and logs the measured geometry.

## Outputs

For each processable input series, the app returns these derived label series:

| Output role | Rule | Label value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `THRESH_LOW` | voxel intensity greater than the series mean | `1` |
| `THRESH_MID` | voxel intensity greater than mean plus half a standard deviation | `2` |
| `THRESH_HIGH` | voxel intensity greater than mean plus one standard deviation | `3` |

Each output is sent as one MRD image per source slice. Source position and
orientation are preserved, while the output pixels are stored as unsigned
integer labels.

## Parameters

| Parameter id | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `config` | choice | `openreconi2iexample` | Selects this OpenRecon app. |
| `sendoriginal` | boolean | `false` | If enabled, returns scanner-safe restamped copies of the original magnitude images as an additional output series. |

## Scanner-Safe Series Identity

Every derived output role receives a fresh `image_series_index` that is distinct
from observed input series indices and reserved scanner indices. The wrapper
sets a unique `SeriesInstanceUID`, a stable `SeriesNumberRangeNameUID`,
`ProtocolName`, `SequenceDescription`, `SeriesDescription`, `ImageTypeValue4`,
and `DataRole` for each derived role.

If source images include an `IceMiniHead`, the same identity fields and slice
numbering fields are patched there as well. Before sending, the wrapper logs an
`OPENRECONI2I_OUTPUT_SERIES_CONTRACT` summary and raises an error if derived
roles collide, reuse input identity, or disagree between Meta and IceMiniHead.

## Runtime Notes

- Runtime debug paths use `/tmp/share/debug` or `/tmp`; no runtime files are
  expected under `/home`.
- This example does not download models or external tools.
- The threshold outputs are intentionally simple so the recipe stays useful as
  an OpenRecon integration template.
