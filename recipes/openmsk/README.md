# OpenMSK OpenRecon

`openmsk` packages the KneePipeline knee MRI toolbox as a Siemens OpenRecon
image-to-image module. It expects reconstructed DESS two-echo Enhanced MR
images arriving as MRD image messages from the scanner.

## Outputs

- Bone, cartilage, and meniscus segmentation as source-geometry derived MRD
  images using the upstream DOSMA/OpenMSK label values.
- Subregion segmentation as a separate derived MRD segmentation series when
  KneePipeline writes `*_subregions-labels.nii.gz`.
- Optional cartilage mesh and thickness outputs in the KneePipeline working
  directory when `computethickness` is enabled.
- Metrics comments on derived metric-bearing outputs and a burned-in metrics
  report image series when KneePipeline writes metrics JSON/CSV files.
- DESS T2 map MRD images and per-region T2 metrics when KneePipeline's
  `steps.t2_mapping` writes `*_t2map.nii.gz` and `*_t2_results.json`.

## Segmentation Labels

Returned segmentation and subregion series use the same public labels as the
upstream GitHub monolith:

| Label | Tissue |
| ---: | --- |
| 0 | Background |
| 1 | Patellar cartilage |
| 2 | Femoral cartilage |
| 3 | Medial tibial cartilage |
| 4 | Lateral tibial cartilage |
| 5 | Medial meniscus |
| 6 | Lateral meniscus |
| 7 | Femur |
| 8 | Tibia |
| 9 | Patella |

Femoral-cartilage subregion output retains the upstream labels 11 anterior,
12 medial weight-bearing, 13 lateral weight-bearing, 14 medial posterior, and
15 lateral posterior.

KneePipeline's modular mesh, thickness, T2, and NSM steps use a canonical
label scheme internally. OpenRecon converts to that scheme only after sending
the public segmentation and converts subregion output back before returning it.

## Output Geometry

Derived series are returned as per-slice MRD images resampled onto the source
image grid, and the scanner's DICOM writer defines the stored dimensions,
spacing, origin, and direction. An offline KneePipeline run on exported DICOMs
works on the DICOM-derived grid instead, so the two outputs are not
voxel-for-voxel identical: comparing them (for example computing DSC or ASSD
against an offline run) requires resampling one result onto the other's grid
first. This is inherent to OpenRecon, not a defect in either output.

## DESS And T2 Caveat

OpenRecon receives MRD images, not the original DICOM. To preserve the DESS
T2 path, the wrapper keeps both echo groups and writes a minimal two-echo MR
DICOM series with `EchoNumbers`, TR/TE/flip angle, and DOSMA's DESS private
GL/TG tags. For a three-volume `sequenceName`, `sequenceName_fid`, and
`sequenceName_SE` input, the unsuffixed volume is excluded, segmentation uses
the voxelwise root-sum-of-squares of `_fid` and `_SE`, and fitting uses the two
echoes separately. Because the scanner labels both echoes with TE1, the wrapper
writes the second echo with
`TE2 = 2 * TR - TE1`. TR/TE1/flip are read from the MRD header or image
metadata when available. GL/TG can come from MRD user parameters or image
metadata; otherwise legacy saved-protocol values and then built-in DESS
defaults are used.

Some scanner exports instead interleave the two echoes in one named series as
equal-sized MRD `set=0` and `set=1` groups. OpenMSK keeps those sets together,
segments their root-sum-of-squares, and uses both sets separately for fitting.
LogViewer reports the detected series/set counts, grouping method, segmentation
and fitting routing, received TE labels, and the corrected TE values.

Runtime logs report the resolved value and source for every DESS fitting
parameter.

The `pymskt` right-knee reference used for cartilage subregion registration is
packaged into the container at build time. Subregion and T2-statistics
post-processing therefore does not require GitHub access at scanner runtime.
If subregion generation nevertheless fails and thickness was not requested,
OpenMSK computes global T2 statistics from the remapped femoral, medial tibial,
lateral tibial, and patellar cartilage labels and does not report that recovery
as a failed post-processing run.

## Parameters

- `sendoriginal`: return original images before derived outputs. Distinct source
  volumes are returned as separately labeled scanner series rather than being
  combined into one series.
- `segmodel`: KneePipeline model name (`acl_qdess_bone_july_2024` by default;
  `goyal_sagittal`, `goyal_coronal`, `goyal_axial`, and `nnunet_knee` are
  also packaged). The packaged `nnunet_knee` path runs nnU-Net with
  scanner-safe single preprocessing/export worker defaults.
- `computethickness`: run slower mesh/thickness analysis after the segmentation
  has been sent.

TR, TE1, and flip angle are read from MRD sequence parameters when available;
TE2 is computed as `2 * TR - TE1`. The current scanner MRD header does not
expose GL area or TG, so this protocol uses the built-in defaults. Acquisition
fallback fields and the ignored legacy `runnsm`/`runbscore` flags remain
accepted in saved protocol configurations, but are intentionally hidden from
the GUI.
